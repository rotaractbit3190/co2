# CO2 Emission Calculator - Learn More

The CO2 Emission Calculator is designed to help individuals calculate their carbon dioxide emissions based on various consumption categories. This document provides detailed information on how the calculator works and how to interpret the results.

## Calculation Methodology

The CO2 Emission Calculator uses the following formulas to calculate emissions:

- **Electricity Emission**: Electricity Consumption (KWh/year) * Emission Factor based on the state you reside in.
- **Fuel Emission**: Distance Driven on Average (KM/year) / Mileage of Vehicle (KMPL) * Fuel Emission Factor.
- **LPG Emission**: Total Cylinders Used (per year) * LPG Emission Factor.
- **Waste Emission**: Waste Thrown Out (KG/year) * Waste Emission Factor.

The emission factors for electricity and waste are based on the state you select, while the emission factors for fuel and LPG are fixed values.

## Result Interpretation

The CO2 Emission Calculator provides the following results:

- **Total CO2 Emission**: The total carbon dioxide emissions in tons per year.
- **Electricity Emission**: The carbon dioxide emissions specifically from electricity consumption.
- **Fuel Emission**: The carbon dioxide emissions specifically from fuel consumption.
- **LPG Emission**: The carbon dioxide emissions specifically from LPG usage.
- **Waste Emission**: The carbon dioxide emissions specifically from waste production.

## Recommendations

Based on your total CO2 emissions, the calculator provides recommendations to reduce your emissions. If your emissions are within an ideal range, a "Great Job!" message will be displayed. If your emissions exceed the ideal range, specific measures will be suggested for each consumption category.
